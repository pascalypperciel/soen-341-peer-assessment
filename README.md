# Peer Assessment System
## Description of the project:
#### Identified Problem
In group projects, it can be difficult for teachers/professors to accurately assess the contribution of each member, and students may feel reluctant to provide honest feedback due to fear of confrontation or bias. This lack of transparency can lead to imbalanced grading and frustration among team members who feel their efforts are not fairly recognized. Consequently, students may not receive the constructive feedback necessary for personal growth and improvement in collaborative settings.

#### Proposed Solution
We are building a web application to fix the problem. This project allows university students doing group projects to rate their group members on a numeric scale based on different criteria. These reviews are anonymous thus increasing the likelihood of honest reviews. The teachers can manage their courses and the different groups. 

    
Overall, this system will give genuine feedback to the students and the instructor in charge of the course.
